# OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM  
  ● Creating a superclass with defined attributes and methods
  ● Creating a subclass that extends the superclass
  ● Invoking superclass methods from the subclass

# OUTCOME
  ● Understand inheritance as a core principle of OOP
  ● Apply the extends keyword in Java
  ● Reuse and override methods of the superclass 
  ● Demonstrate method access across class hierarchies

  # WHAT IS SINGLE INHERITANCE

  Single Inheritance is a type of inheritance where one subclass inherits from one superclass.
Structure:
Superclass
↑
Subclass
The child class can access all non-private members of the parent class.
Java supports single inheritance directly using the extends keyword.
Syntax:
class Superclass {
// Fields and methods
}
class Subclass extends Superclass {
// Additional fields and methods
}



# CONCLUSION

The experiment successfully demonstrates single inheritance in Java, where a subclass reuses and
enhances the features of its superclass by extending it. This helps in designing modular and
reusable code.
